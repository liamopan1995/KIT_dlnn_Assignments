 Exercise 2B needs further improvements at some places
 
        Things to Do: 
                      Improve numerical stability of self implemented functions
                      Implementation of spectral normalization and conv and conv2d and upsampling

 Exercise 2A is still being worked on : 
 
        Next Step : 
                      overfit model on one single batch
