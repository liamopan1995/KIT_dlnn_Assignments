## Exercise 2B : Gan vanilla, DCGAN,LSGAN
### Goals:
   To build a simple generative adversarial network to perform image generation, and improve it to become DCGAN,LSGAN to increase its performance ...
### States: 
   Trainings were done with good results,
   but needs little further improvements for some places
 
### Things to Do: 
    Improve numerical stability of self implemented functions,
    Implementation of spectral normalization and conv and conv2d and upsampling

## Exercise 2A : Training Encoder only -Transformer(bert liked).
 
### Goals: 
    Implement a basic encoder-only Transformer architecture with PyTorch. We will start with building the basic building blocks and then integrate them into a fully-    fleged Transformer model. We train the model to solve a POS-Tagging problem 
   
### States:    
    Is still being worked on,
    Model is built, 
    Datapreprossesing is completed.
 
### Next Steps : 
    Overfit model on one single batch
